An open source and web-based application to store, display, manipulate and share structured collections of design heuristics.

## What it is for

Heuristics play a great role in design creativity and learning. There is generally no systematic method designers can be provided with in order to derive optimal design solutions. In other words, it is neither possible to list all solutions to a given problem nor to prove the absolute superiority of a given solution. However, guidance can be provided to designers in the form of heuristics, i.e. set of solutions validated by practice, which have proven to lead towards satisfactory solutions, but which are not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect. Heuristics express a supposed causal relation between two design parameters. For example, in the context of automobile development, “overall weight” has a direct relation with “energy consumption in use.”

This tool allows displaying the network built by all causal relations between design parameters. It provides an environment to explore and navigate in this network in order to support creativity in design.

## Installation and use
There is no installation required. Just download the package on a local folder. 
To use the application, open the file "Design-dependencies.html" with a web brower. That's it! 
The tool is still under development, so there is no user manual so far. Work in progress...
